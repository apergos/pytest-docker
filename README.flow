Anatomy of a test suite run

PREP

First, each prep script in the 'prep' phase described in your
top level config.py is run on the hosts specified for it,
with the interpreter specified (or with no interpreter,
if 'execute' is set to '')

Things that could happen in this phase are:
  - setting the locale on the containers to C instead of whatever
    funny language you have on your laptop (yes I do this)
  - setting the timezone in your containers to match the
    tz of your test suite launch host, so that comparisons
    of file timestamps work
  - any other things that need to be done only once at the
    beginning of the whole suite

FOR EACH JOB

The follwing are done for each job in the test suite.

Data

Every file specified in the 'data' section in your
top level config.py is copied into place on the hosts
specified for it and in the location specified, untarring
also if specified.

Mods

Every script listed in the 'mods' section in the config.py
file in the directory for that job is copied to the remote
hosts listed in the location specified and is then run
using the interpreter specified or without an interpreter
if 'execute' is set to ''.

Main

Each script in the 'main' section in the config.py file
in the directory for that job file is patched, if a patch
is specified for the script, copied to the remote hosts
specified and in the location specified, and then run
from there with the desired inerpreter, or with no interpreter
if 'execute' is set to ''.

Collect

The output results from the test job are collected by running each
script listed in the 'collect' section of the config.py script
for that job on the hosts specified and with the interpreter
specified, or with no interpreter if 'execute' is set to ''.
No arguments are passed to the script.

If the script produces output that needs to be checked later
by the verify script, the attribute 'results' should give the
full path to the file on the remote host that will contain that
output.

In this case the results file will be copied back to the
local host in jobs/<jobname>/tmp/results_<hostname>  and the verify
script(s) shoul

Verify

Then the collected output results are checked by running each
script specified in the 'verify' section of the config.py script
for that job on the hosts specified and with the interpreter
specified, or with no interpreter if 'execute' is set to ''.

The script will be run on the test suite launch host if the
attribute 'remote' is not present or is set to None.
Otherwise it will have been copied to the location specified
on the specified hosts and will be run from there.

Output  comparison of collcted output results, and any other
functionality needed to verify that the output is as expected,
must be handled entirely by the verify scripts.  No post-processing
is provided, no extra hooks or anything else.

Note that this means you need to find the job name
from the full path of the verify script being invoked, as it
will be called tests/job/<jobname>/verify/<scriptname>
You need this in order to find the per host results files
described in the 'collect' phase.

CLEANUP

This is done after all test jobs in the suite have run and been
checked.

Each script in the 'cleanup' phase described in your
top level config.py is run on the hosts specified for it,
with the interpreter specified (or with no interpreter,
if 'execute' is set to '')

In general, here you want to undo the changes you made in the prep
phase.
