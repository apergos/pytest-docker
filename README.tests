Setting up your data and scripts for testing

Set up a subdirectory 'tests' with the following in it:

prep      -- this will contain all scripts to be run on hosts
             ahead of the tests
data      -- this will contain all files and data that should
             be put into place on the hosts where the tests
             will be run

jobs      -- for each phase of the tests, this will contain a
             subdirctory with th directories 'mods' containing
             scripts that alter data or make changes on the hosts
             before the test phase run, and 'patches' which will
             be applied to the scripts to be tested

             it will also contain a config.py file describing
             the mods... meh...

main      -- this will contain the scripts or programs that are to
             be tested

tmp       -- scratch area (do we need to create ahead of time?)

verify    -- this will contain all scripts that collect and
             check test output from the hosts

cleanup   -- this will contain all scripts to be run on hosts
             after tests have run and results have been checked
